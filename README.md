### Overview
**Benchmarkus** is a performance-focused experimental project by [barisozgenn](https://github.com/barisozgenn). It leverages **.NET** and **BenchmarkDotNet** to explore how various coding patterns, framework features, runtime behaviors, and system-level optimizations influence application performance.

This repository aims to serve as a testing ground:  
- **Analyze Different Approaches:** Compare memory usage, throughput, allocation rates, and timing differences across multiple implementations.  
- **Evaluate Patterns & Techniques:** Investigate how common architectural patterns or coding idioms perform under real-world and synthetic workloads.  
- **Discover Optimizations:** Identify subtle changes that impact runtime efficiency, from micro-optimizations to improvements in asynchronous code or data processing strategies.

---

### What’s Inside
- **Broad Performance Coverage:** Benchmarks addressing concerns from basic operations to more complex architectural patterns.  
- **Methodology & Best Practices:** Encourage systematic measurement, proper environment setup, and reproducible results.  
- **Dynamic Experimentation:** Support for trying new concepts at runtime, exploring different ways of object creation, method invocation, and feature toggling—without committing to a single approach.

---

### Goals
- **Practical Insights:** Help developers understand which coding patterns might lead to more efficient software.  
- **Informed Decision-Making:** Provide data to guide architectural and implementation decisions instead of relying solely on intuition.  
- **Community Involvement:** Offer a platform where others can contribute their ideas, scenarios, and code patterns, and learn from collective experimentation.
