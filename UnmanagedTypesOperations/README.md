# UnmanagedTypesOperations

This project is part of the **Benchmarkus** repository and is focused on benchmarking memory allocations and performance for various **unmanaged types** and **common .NET types** such as arrays, strings, decimals, booleans, and user-defined structs. It uses [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet) to measure allocation size, speed, and other memory metrics under different scenariosâ€”both single allocations and repeated allocations in loops.

## Why We Do It

- **Memory Allocation Insights**: Identify how much memory is allocated when using different .NET types in various scenarios.  
- **Performance Awareness**: Understand the impact of repeated allocations on performance and garbage collection.  
- **Unmanaged Type Exploration**: Validate the size and behavior of unmanaged generic structs (like `SomeVariableTypeGeneric<T>`) in .NET.

## What We Can Learn

- **Allocation Patterns**: Observe how single allocations differ from bulk (looped) allocations in terms of total allocated bytes and execution time.  
- **Cost of Strings & Arrays**: Compare memory usage among different types, including arrays, strings, booleans, decimals, and user-defined unmanaged structs.  
- **BenchmarkDotNet Usage**: Gain familiarity with how BenchmarkDotNet collects, measures, and reports on memory allocations in a standardized manner.

### Purpose & Motivation

- **Measure Allocations**: Quantify the memory usage of various .NET types under realistic workloads.  
- **Demonstrate Unmanaged Generics**: Show how `sizeof(T)` works for unmanaged type parameters in generic structs.  
- **Educate & Optimize**: Help developers make informed decisions when optimizing memory usage in performance-critical scenarios.

### Key Focus Areas

1. **Types Benchmarked**:
   - **Arrays** (`int[]`, `bool[]`, `decimal[]`, etc.)
   - **Strings** (varying lengths)
   - **Value Types** (e.g., `decimal`, `bool`, `int`, `double`)
   - **Unmanaged Generics** (e.g., `SomeVariableTypeGeneric<int>`, `SomeVariableTypeGeneric<double>`)

2. **Allocation Scenarios**:
   - **Single Allocation** (allocate once, measure overhead)
   - **Repeated Allocations** (allocate in loops, measure cumulative overhead)

3. **Metrics Collected**:
   - **Allocated Bytes**
   - **Gen0 / Gen1 / Gen2 Collections**
   - **Execution Time (Mean, Error, StdDev)**

### Goals

- **Benchmark Memory Footprint**: Precisely measure how memory usage scales when instantiating different types.  
- **Verify Unmanaged Struct Sizes**: Confirm the actual `sizeof` for structs constrained with `unmanaged`.  
- **Provide Actionable Data**: Help developers make data-driven choices about which types to use or how best to allocate them.

### Benchmark Results Across .NET Versions

Below are **placeholder tables** for different .NET SDK versions. After you run the benchmarks under each target framework (`net9.0`, `net10.0`), you can fill in the results accordingly. Each table compares **single** vs. **loop** allocations for various types and methods.

### Conclusion

This **BenchmarkDotNet** project offers valuable insights into **memory allocations** for arrays, strings, decimals, booleans, and unmanaged generic structs in .NET. By running these benchmarks under different .NET versions (6, 7, 8, 9, 10), you can observe:

- **Allocation Overhead**: How large or repetitive allocations can impact total memory usage and trigger garbage collections.  
- **Type Efficiency**: The relative memory costs for different data types in single vs. repeated allocation scenarios.  
- **Struct Sizing**: Verification of `sizeof(T)` for unmanaged generic structs, helping to confirm your assumptions about memory layout.

**Key Takeaways**:

1. **Release Mode Matters**: Always build and run the benchmarks in **Release** mode to get accurate measurements.  
2. **Large Strings vs. Small Arrays**: Certain types (like large strings) can quickly inflate memory usage; arrays are often more predictable.  
3. **Repeated Allocations**: Allocating objects in loops can amplify memory usage significantly, highlighting how ephemeral objects may impact performance.  
4. **Unmanaged Generics**: Confirming the size of unmanaged structs helps you design data-centric APIs or high-performance scenarios with more confidence.  

Feel free to add more data types, experiment with concurrency, or integrate additional metrics. The final data in these tables can be used to guide performance optimizations and memory usage decisions in real-world .NET applications.
